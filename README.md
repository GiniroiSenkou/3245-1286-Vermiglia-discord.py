# Vermiglia-discord.py
Various snippets for moderation and functions that you may find useful on discord.

## Requirements
discord2.0 = ``` pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@master ```

## How to Use?
The "index.py" code is the main structure. Inside you'll find an area where you can insert any "Snippets" from the Snippets Folder that I have made. 
config.ini is where you set your prefernces and the BOT TOKEN.

## Tested On
Python3.9 - Linux 

## Credits
The "index.py" is the main structure that I'm using for the rest and it has been inspired from https://github.com/TheRadziu/DiscordFilterBot although it has been modified and fixed to run newer versions of discord.
